# Table-Mark-Project
The Table Mark Project is a lightweight yet powerful tool designed to automatically detect and highlight tables in architectural, engineering, or scanned drawing PDFs. It extracts structured tabular data from each page and visually marks detected tables using red rectangular boxes for easy review and annotation.
